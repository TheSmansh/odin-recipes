# odin-recipes

this is my first project using TOP. the current project is to make a basic recipe websit. i am very nervous as of right now, but there are a few things that i hope to be better at by 
the time i am finished with this project. here is a list of the things i would like to have greatly improved on:

understand my own file management better
be able to write an HTML boilerplate from muscle memory
very easily add links and images to my HTML files.


lets see how this goes!
